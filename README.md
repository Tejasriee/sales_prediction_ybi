# 📊 Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts product sales based on advertising budgets using a **Linear Regression** model.  
The dataset includes advertising expenditure on **TV, Radio, and Newspaper**, and the goal is to analyze their impact on **Sales**.

The project is implemented using **Python** and executed on **Google Colab**.

## 🎯 Objective
- To analyze the relationship between advertising budgets and sales
- To build a machine learning model for sales prediction
- To evaluate the model using standard performance metrics

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- **TV** – TV advertising budget  
- **Radio** – Radio advertising budget  
- **Newspaper** – Newspaper advertising budget  
- **Sales** – Sales value (target variable)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is performed using:
- Bar charts
- Scatter plots
- Histogram
- Pairplot

These visualizations help in understanding trends and correlations in the data.

## 🤖 Model
- **Linear Regression**
- Train-test split applied
- Model evaluated using:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 🔮 Prediction
Sample advertising budget values are used to predict sales.  
The values can be modified to generate predictions for different scenarios.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 💻 Platform
- Google Colab

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for predicting sales using advertising data.  
Linear Regression proves to be an effective model for understanding sales trends.
